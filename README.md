# Pod Assignments

## Pods are your primary point of contact with your Cohort Lead every week. Attendance will be tracked, and it's the best way for both of us to assess your level of understanding each week.  Please come prepared with your questions and make every effort to attend each week.

### I made pod assignments as much as possible based on student availability as submitted.  With the large number of students and the low submission rate, there are likely to be further adjustments in assignments and pod times.  I appreciate your patience.

|  | TBA | TBA

# Pair Programming Assignments

### Please contact your partner below and arrange a weekly time to meet for pair programming.  You can use [this calendar](https://www.when2meet.com/?9139773-MqhEY) to help you find a time that works. If you cannot find any time, let me know and I'll help you find new partners.  If you have any questions what you should do, rewatch the video from First Mile linked below, and/or see these [best practices](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/pairing-best-practices).  When you have done your pair programming for the week, please submit [this very short form](https://forms.gle/DsiBCPXm1TFU88dz5)
